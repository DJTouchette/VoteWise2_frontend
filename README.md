# Angula skeleton with basic example !

I forked https://github.com/angular/angular-seed, go read there readme!

## What your gonna need

1) Open up your terminal

2) `sudo npm install -g bower` ( Bower is used like NPM but for front end assets, `-g` installs it globally )

3) from the root of your folder run `npm start`

`npm start` will run `npm install`, then `bower install`, then launch the angular http server for you. The app is live at http://localhost:8000

4) Make sure you `git pull` the API to get the latest changes

5) In the root folder of `VoteWise2` ( our API ) run `node server.js`. Our Angular app will be making a simple request to it.

6) Go to `VoteWise2_frontend`, go to app/view1.js and read the comments!

7) Have fun!
